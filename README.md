NLP Project – Main Project 📌 Overview

This project is part of the NLP Course (NTI). It demonstrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and comparison across different algorithms.

The project includes:

Dataset preparation and cleaning

Feature extraction (e.g., TF-IDF, embeddings)

Model training (classical ML & deep learning approaches)

Evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
